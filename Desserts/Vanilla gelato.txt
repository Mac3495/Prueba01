Put egg yolk into a medium bowl and whisk until slightly thickened.
Pour 1 cup of the hot milk mixture into the yolk, whisking constantly, then gradually add mixture back into the
hot milk mixture in the saucepan, stirring with a wooden spoon. Set aside to let cool, stirring often,
then cover with plastic and refrigerate overnight. Remove and discard vanilla bean.
